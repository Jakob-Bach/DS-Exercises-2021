\begin{itemize}
	\item Responsible: \href{https://dbis.ipd.kit.edu/2562.php}{Jakob Bach}
	\item Goals:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Deepen understanding of the contents from the lecture
		\item Prepare for exam
		\item Acquire practical data-science skills (programming, analysis of results)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Four topics:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Fundamentals
		\item Classification
		\item Association rules
		\item Clustering and outlier detection
	\end{itemize}
	\item Three components: exercise sessions, online tests, programming exercises $\rightarrow$ see following slide
	\item Exercises are not graded (i.e., not mandatory for exam)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Exercises (II)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Exercise sessions
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Four Mondays (15.11., 13.12., 10.01., 07.02), 10:00-11:30
		\item In person, not streamed/recorded (but written summary)
		\item We discuss theory-related questions, prepared and answered by you
	\end{itemize}
	\item Online tests on ILIAS
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Published once lecture has progressed far enough
		\item Solve them whenever you like and as often as you like
		\item 10-15 questions
		\item Automatic evaluation, explanations for solutions
	\end{itemize}
	\item Programming exercises (exercise sheets)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Published once lecture has progressed far enough
		\item Solution videos and notebooks published one week before corresponding exercise session (so you can ask questions then)
		\item Feel free to solve them in pairs or even larger teams
		\item Use Python, in particular \texttt{pandas} and \texttt{sklearn}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
