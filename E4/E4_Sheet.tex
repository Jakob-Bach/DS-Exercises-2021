\section*{Setup}

Compared to the previous exercise sheets, you should install \code{pydataset}.
Besides that, we will work with \code{matplotlib}, \code{pandas}, \code{scikit-learn}, and \code{seaborn}.

\section*{Task: Clustering and Outlier Detection}

The aim of this exercise is to apply clustering and outlier-detection approaches.
We work with the \code{faithful} dataset, which you can obtain from package \code{pydataset} with \code{data('faithful')}.
The \href{https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/faithful}{dataset} contains eruption times and (between-eruption) waiting times for the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Faithful}{geyser Old Faithful}.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*), left=0pt, itemsep=12pt]
	\item
	\taskname{Visualization}
	Load the data and normalize it with an instance of \code{StandardScaler} from \code{sklearn.preprocessing}.
	Create a scatter plot of the data points and create histograms of their distribution.
	In particular, also use two-dimensional histograms, which are available in \code{matplotlib} as well as \code{seaborn}.
	\newline
	Where are potential clusters?
	Which points might be outliers?
	Why have we normalized the data beforehand?
	\item
	\taskname{K-Means}
	Train an instance of \code{KMeans} from \code{sklearn.cluster}.
	Visualize the results (e.g., by coloring the points according to their cluster membership in a scatter plot) for different values of \textit{k}.
	Use \code{silhouette\_score()} from \code{sklearn.metrics} to assess the quality of the k-means results.
	\newline
	Why does k-means produce these results?
	Is the silhouette coefficient a useful metric to assess clustering quality here?
	\item
	\taskname{DBSCAN}
	Train an instance of \code{DBSCAN} from \code{sklearn.cluster} and visualize the result as before.
	\newline
	Why do you obtain such a result?
	Are you able to improve the result with hyperparameter tuning based on the silhouette coefficient?
	\item
	\taskname{OPTICS}
	Train an instance of \code{OPTICS} from \code{sklearn.cluster} and create a reachability plot based on the attributes of the trained instance.
	\newline
	Can you use this plot to determine a good value for DBSCAN's hyperparameter $\epsilon$?
	\item
	\taskname{Outlier Detection}
	Detect outliers in the data with the help of \code{NearestNeighbors} from \code{sklearn.neighbors}, a distance-based approach, and \code{LocalOutlierScore} from \code{sklearn.neighbors}, a density-based approach.
	Visualize the data points together with their outlier scores, e.g., by scaling the size and/or color of the points in a scatter plot accordingly.
	\newline
	For which data points do the results of the two approaches differ strongly and why?
	\item
	\taskname{Subspace Outliers}
	Calculate the outlier scores for each feature of the dataset separately.
	Compare these results to your previous two-dimensional approach.
	\newline
	Are there points which only appear to be outliers in one subspace?
	Are there non-trivial outliers in the data?
